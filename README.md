### Description
  I have created a vulnerable box that mimics an industry-based server and has a vulnerable web application hosted in it. Exploiting and gaining root access to this machine can give you immense knowledge of pen-testing and privilege techniques. Try it out on your own and if stuck somewhere feel free to go through the writeup file which I have uploaded.
#### Happy Hacking!!!
